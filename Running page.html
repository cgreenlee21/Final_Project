Running has been a passion of mine for a while now. I only started cross-country and track in 7th grade, but even before that I always remember running the mile and the pacer test in school wanting to do it as fast as I possibly could.
<br>
<br>
When I started out I was no where near being a good runner, but through a lot of hard work and thousands of miles in and out of season I made my way up to varsity level apart of a team that qualified for state almost every year in Track and Cross-Country.
<br>
<br>
Some of my favorite running memories ever include my two track PR's I got during my senior Track season
<br>
<br>
The first one was running a 4:28 Mile to qualify for sectionals

<br>
<br>
This is me and my teammate after the race. Both of us ran a PR in that mile and qualified for the sectional race.
<br>
<br>
The other memory is Anchoring our team's 4x800 at the state meet and sprinting past someone in the final straight, and finishing my split in a time of 2:00.

I now just run for the enjoyment of it and compete for fun with the Mizzou Run Club which has been a super fun experience!
