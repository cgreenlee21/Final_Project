<p> I first began playing the saxophone in 7th grade and have been playing ever since.<br>
Here is a picture of younger me with my Baritone Saxophone at All-State Band Freshman year</p>

<p>I was a member of the Missouri All-State Band for all four years of high school </p>

<p>I originally started on the Tenor Saxophone, and eventually picked up the Baritone my freshman year and just started playing Alto saxophone last year.</p>

<p> I received a scholarship to play saxophone at the University of Missouri and so far it has been an amazing experience.</p>
